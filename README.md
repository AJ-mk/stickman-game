# stickman-game
My first dream game on JavaScript... Yes, it's just a prototype for now, not even a beta. I'm working on it in my free time.
# How to launch? 
Open the .html file called: "The Stickman Fighting" on any browser, but preferably on Google Chrome.
# Technologies used
No libraries, frameworks or dependencies, just native HTML, CSS and JS. Stickmen and their animations were created using "Pivot Animator v5" and then converted into sprite sheets with JSON data using "Texture Packer".
# License
Free. You can change and add your ideas as you wish, but only for entertainment purposes.
